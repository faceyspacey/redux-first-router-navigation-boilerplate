# Redux-First Router Navigation Boilerplate

To get this to work you will need to install React Native Debugger:

https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router-navigation-boilerplate
cd redux-first-router-navigation-boilerplate
yarn
yarn start
```

## What To Do
- examine the components (particularly Navigators: Stack.js, Tabs.js, Drawer.js, and secondly Screens: RecentChats, Notfications, Chats. In that order.)
- examine the reducers
- examine src/index.js
- examine src/configureStore.js
- examine index.ios.js

At one point I got it working with deep linking in Android, but haven't visited that in a while. So assume it's iOS only.
